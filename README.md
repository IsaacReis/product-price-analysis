# Product Price Analysis (WIP)

This is a simple Python project to analyze and visualize the price variation of products over time using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**.

> ⚠️ This project is a work in progress — more features, analysis, and refinements will be added as I continue learning these libraries.

## Project Goals

- Continue practicing and improving Python programming skills
- Practice data analysis with **Pandas**
- Perform basic statistics with **NumPy**
- Generate visual insights using **Matplotlib**
- Organize Python code into clean, reusable modules
